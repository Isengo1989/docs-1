# API

The Shopware API allows developers to interact with and integrate Shopware with other systems and applications. It provides a set of services that enable developers to perform various operations, such as managing products, customers, orders, and shopping carts. The API supports both read and write operations, allowing developers to retrieve information from Shopware and make modifications or additions to the e-commerce platform. By leveraging the Shopware API, developers can extend the functionality of Shopware, integrate it with external systems, and create seamless experiences for managing and operating online stores.

Shopware supports two major functional APIs: the Store API and the Admin API. These APIs serve different purposes. The Store API is designed to interact with the front-end or storefront of a Shopware online store while the Admin API is intended for administrative operations related to managing the back-end of the Shopware platform.

The API documentation provides details on the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and data structures. It supports different authentication methods, including token-based authentication and OAuth 2.0, to ensure secure communication between the API client and the Shopware platform.

## Store API

The Store API has been improved with the addition of association descriptions in the OpenAPI documentation. This enhancement provides more detailed information about the associations between different entities in the API, making it easier for developers to understand and use the API effectively.

### Shipping Method Schema

The schema for the shipping method in the Store API has been updated. Please refer to the updated OpenAPI documentation for the new schema details.

## Admin API

The Admin API now includes the `AssociationDescription` flag. This flag provides a description of the association between different entities in the API. This addition helps developers understand the relationships between different entities and how they can be used in the API.

### Entity Definitions

The entity definitions in the Admin API have been updated. These updates reflect changes in the underlying code and provide more accurate and up-to-date information for developers. Please refer to the updated API documentation for the new entity definitions.

## Test Suite

The test suite for the Store API has been updated to include tests for the new association descriptions. These tests ensure that the association descriptions are accurate and up-to-date. Developers should refer to the updated test suite documentation for details on these new tests.

## Conclusion

These updates to the Shopware API provide more detailed and accurate information for developers, making it easier to use the API effectively. By understanding the associations between different entities and having up-to-date entity definitions, developers can create more powerful and efficient integrations with Shopware.
