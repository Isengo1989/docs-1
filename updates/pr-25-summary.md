## What Changed

### API Changes

## Impact Assessment

The changes have a moderate to high impact on the API and backend guides. Developers using the API will need to understand the new `AssociationDescription` flag and how to use it. The improved Store API OpenAPI documentation will provide more detailed information about the associations in the API.

## Action Items for Users/Developers
