# Home

Let us help you guide through the landscape of knowledge for Shopware 6. This documentation is organised in order to facilitate knowledge for different **products**, **topics** and **depths** of interest.

The two main sections **concepts** and **guides** assist you to navigate the documentation according to your needs.

Whereas **Concepts** convey the ideas, inner workings and architectural considerations behind our product, **Guides** provide explicit examples, step-by-step tutorials that deal with specific tasks.

These two sections are complemented by the **References**, which contain structured code references, lists of flags, commands, endpoints which are useful for development.

In the recent update, we have added a new flag `AssociationDescription` to our API. This flag is used to provide a description for associations in our API. You can find more details about this flag in the **References** section.

We have also made changes to our OpenAPI schema generator for Store API endpoints. These changes are reflected in the **Guides** section under the tutorial for using the OpenAPI schema generator.

The `RELEASE_INFO-6.7.md` file has been updated to include detailed information about these changes. You can find this file in the root directory of the Shopware 6 repository.
