# Database Documentation

## PR Title: test: storefront-changes

This PR introduces significant changes to the Shopware platform, particularly in the areas of API, Backend, and Frontend. The changes are related to cookies, product details, promotion discounts, configuration files, and localization. 

## Schema Changes and Migrations

The PR adds three new JSON files:

1. `CookieEntry.json`: This file defines the schema for a cookie entry in the Shopware platform. It includes fields for the cookie's name, group, technical name, and other properties.

2. `CookieGroup.json`: This file defines the schema for a group of cookies. It includes fields for the group's name, technical name, and the cookies it contains.

3. `cookie.json`: This file defines the API paths for managing cookies in the Shopware platform. It includes paths for getting, creating, updating, and deleting cookies.

## New/Modified/Removed Tables or Fields

The PR does not appear to modify any existing tables or fields in the database. However, it does introduce new concepts (cookie entries and groups) that may require new tables or fields in the future.

## Data Migration Requirements

As this PR introduces new schemas, there may be a need for data migration. Existing cookies may need to be grouped into cookie groups, and each cookie may need to be updated with its new properties as defined in the `CookieEntry.json` schema.

## Performance Implications

The PR does not appear to have any immediate performance implications. However, the addition of new API paths for managing cookies could potentially increase the load on the server, especially if there are a large number of cookies to manage.

## Backup Recommendations Before Upgrade

Before applying this PR, it is recommended to backup the entire database. This will allow for a rollback in case of any issues during the upgrade process.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation updates are recommended:

- Update the API documentation to include the new paths for managing cookies.
- Update the backend documentation to explain the new cookie entry and group schemas.
- Update the frontend documentation to explain how cookies are now managed in the Shopware platform.
- Update the deployment documentation to account for any changes in configuration files.
- Update the localization documentation to reflect changes in the `src/Storefront/Resources/snippet` files.
