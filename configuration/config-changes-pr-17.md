# Configuration Documentation

## Overview

This PR introduces significant changes to the Shopware platform, particularly in the areas of API, Backend, and Frontend. The changes are related to cookies, product details, promotion discounts, configuration files, and localization. This requires significant documentation review and updates.

## Configuration Changes

### API

Three new JSON files have been added to the `src/Core/Framework/Api/ApiDefinition/Generator/Schema/StoreApi` directory:

- `CookieEntry.json`
- `CookieGroup.json`
- `cookie.json`

These files define new schemas for handling cookies in the Shopware API. 

### Backend

The `src/Core/Content/Resources/config/routes.xml` file has been modified with an additional route. The exact changes are not specified in the PR.

### Frontend

Several changes have been made to the frontend, particularly in the `src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/layout/cookie` directory:

- `cookie-configuration-child.html.twig` has been modified with 7 additions and 3 deletions.
- `cookie-configuration-group.html.twig` has been modified with 9 additions and 5 deletions.
- `cookie-configuration-parent.html.twig` has been modified with 3 additions and 2 deletions.

These changes likely involve updates to the layout and functionality of the cookie configuration interface.

### Localization

Changes have been made to the `src/Storefront/Resources/snippet` files for both German (`de_DE`) and English (`en_GB`). These changes likely involve updates to the text displayed in the frontend.

## Recommendations

- Update the documentation to reflect the new cookie-related classes and their usage.
- Document the changes in the frontend, particularly in product details and promotion discounts.
- Update the deployment processes documentation due to changes in configuration files.
- Update the localization documentation to reflect changes in the `src/Storefront/Resources/snippet` files.
- Document the changes in the database schema introduced by the new JSON files.
